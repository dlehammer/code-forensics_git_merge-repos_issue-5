=== Order

You can configure your cache definitions to be loaded before or after others by
setting the `order` attribute. Configurations with higher numbers are loaded
later, so these can override previously-configured values, although there is no
support for removing caches or cache attributes, only adding or overriding:

[source,groovy]
----
order = 2000

config = {
   cache {
      name 'message'
   }
   cache {
      name 'maps'
   }
}
----
